# Instructions

- Open git bash. Please work only in git bash, because it's linux terminal
- Go to your project, example: ```cd /c/Users/kadyr/project/```
- Run command to initialize database: ```make db```

'make' - is a tool for reruning commands, you don't need to write every time.
You need to write commands in Makefile, you can look at Makefile for example.

'db' command in Makefile creates database, which reading from init.sql file
and also creates table that reads from create.sql

For 'run' command I think you don't need commentary.

- Your database is initialized. Now you can run command: ```make run```
